        <h1>About This project</h1>
        <p>
          The reason I created this project was because I really like using a
          utility-first CSS framework. It allowed me to be super productive and
          to be enjoy writing CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a developer, I really love re-usability. I don't want to waste my
          time building the same design over and over again. I prefer to learn
          new things and allocate my time and energy to more complex tasks
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm pretty sure this project will be beneficial to all Front-end
          Developers who love using Tailwind. If this project saved you some
          time, consider donating
        </p>
